## Self-hosting
This step-by-step guide assumes you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) version `16.6.0` or higher installed and that you have a Discord Bot user set up at [Discord's developer page](https://discord.com/developers/applications) that has been invited to your server with the `bot` scope and the `applications.commands` scope.

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a file named `.env`  in the root directory and insert the Discord API token for your bot:
   ```bash
   DISCORD_API_TOKEN=abcd1234...
   ```
3. Run `npm install`
4. Make sure the bot has the required permissions in Discord:
   - [x] View channels
   - [x] Send messages
   - [x] Send messages in threads
   - [x] Create public threads
   - [x] Read message history
5. Run `npm start`
6. Deploy! :tada:
